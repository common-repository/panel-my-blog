<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Initially, <strong>PANEL-MY-BLOG</strong> is a plugin which was developed to dynamically manage 301 redirects, so broken links to articles on your Wordpress blog.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It has been expanded a few features that surround these redirects. Indeed, the manager of a website can not doubt all calls to pages that do not exist on his blog. Some visitors become so ill-intentioned. That is why this plugin dynamically manages the blaclisting through HTACCESS file. Warning, so those who already have a file HTACCESS on their blog, although Wordpress does not generate. Because this file would be prepared manually crushed by that of <strong>Panel-My-Blog</strong> !</p>
It comes with four sub-menus :
<ol>
  <li>View all request for 404 error to optimize your web site</li>
	<li>Redirect 301 (dynamically manages the broken links after validation)</li>
	<li>Blacklist (maintains a list of hackers fontion a list of words to block in options)</li>
	<li>Options (manages a basic maintenance mode, the hotlinking...)</li>
	<li>This help menu <u>to read first</u></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You should know that this plugin is installed normally but it is also fully manage its removal: it will leave your own database if you wanted to delete it from your plugins.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>REDIRECT 301</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">... is composed of an array with three main columns, composed of a header line which is found in all sousenus plugin also:</p>
<ol>
	<li> <strong>"X"</strong> for removing the entry</li>
	<li><strong>"M"</strong> for input change</li>
	<li><strong>"TAG"</strong> that is le broken link of one to your articles</li>
  <li><strong>DROPDOWN LIST</strong> for 404 errors for automatic <strong>LINK</strong> below.</li>
  <li><strong>"LIEN"</strong> to inquire into full URL</li>
	<li><strong>"COUNT"</strong> that is the counter for the entry</li>
  <li> <strong> "BOT" </ strong> checkbox used to enregistrer in the virtual robot file links in removal request - error 410 </ li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, an article "www.monsite.fr/my-first-article.html" was deleted. When a robot or visitor will use this URL, a new entry will be made with <strong>TAG</strong> "/my-first-article.html" with <strong>CODE</strong> "404" (which indicate that this entry is new and the <strong>LINK</strong> will be filled only by the URL of your site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After intelligence <strong>LINK</strong>, you could very well make it point to a keyword that was included in the article, like "http://www.monsite.fr/tag/actualite" , the entry will go into <strong>CODE</strong> 301 after page validation. Unless you wish to delete this entry simply by clicking the button <strong>"X"</strong>. In this case, the entry will be deleted after page validation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note that if you delete an entry, it should not surprise you that it is r√©inscrive later due to passage of robots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you wish to notify the bots to remove this URL, put the <strong>LINK</strong> vacuum to pass the <strong>CODE</strong> to 410.</p>
